# /slop-review

Open the diff review UI in your browser so the user can leave inline / file-level / overall comments on the current changes (a.k.a. the slop), then address each comment.

## Step 1 — run the dispatcher

Invoke this exact shell command using your shell/bash tool. It starts a local HTTP review server and opens your browser, then blocks until the user clicks **Submit feedback** or **Cancel**, or you send Ctrl-C. **Closing the browser tab does not cancel** the review — use the Cancel button or Ctrl-C. This call may take a long time — that is expected. Do **not** run anything else in parallel; wait for it to finish.

```bash
if [ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ] && [ -x "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/plugin-run.sh" ]; then
  bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/plugin-run.sh" $ARGUMENTS
elif [ -n "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ] && [ -x "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/plugin-run.sh" ]; then
  bash "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/plugin-run.sh" $ARGUMENTS
elif command -v slop-review >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  slop-review $ARGUMENTS
else
  echo "slop-review is not available. Install the plugin via your agent's plugin/marketplace command, or run: npm install -g slop-review" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Substitute the user's `$ARGUMENTS` into that block verbatim. Valid first arguments:

- *(none)* — default `base` scope: all changes since the merge-base with the auto-detected base branch (`origin/HEAD` → `origin/main` → `main` → `origin/master` → `master`).
- `last-commit` — `HEAD^ → HEAD`.
- `uncommitted` — working-tree changes vs `HEAD`.
- `all` — debug / browse-only.
- `--base <ref>` — override the auto-detected base branch (only meaningful with `base`).

## Step 2 — interpret the dispatcher's stdout

Read the captured stdout from the previous step:

- **`FEEDBACK_FILE: <absolute path>`** → use the file-reading tool to load that file. Its contents are numbered review comments, optionally with an "Overall" comment block. Address each numbered item carefully (edit code, run tests, etc.). When done, give the user a brief summary of what you changed, item by item.
- **`REVIEW_CANCELLED`** → reply with a single short line confirming the review was cancelled. Do not do anything else.
- **anything else** (e.g. an error) → surface the error to the user verbatim and stop.

Status / progress messages from the dispatcher are written to **stderr**, not stdout, so they don't affect the parsing above.

## Notes

- The review UI loads Tailwind and Monaco from public CDNs, so the browser needs internet access — it will **not** render offline.
- **Closing the browser tab does not cancel** the review. Use the **Cancel** button in the UI or send Ctrl-C to abort; otherwise the command stays blocked until you act.
